This is a device that helps blind people. It is a glove loaded with a camera module (ESP32CAM) and a pi 0 w. It describes the pointed scene to the visually impaired person wearing the glove.

This was my entry for Autodesk Instructable Make A Tool 2025 contest. Instrcuctable-> https://www.instructables.com/DrishtiY/

Some extra testing and future implementation codes are also given in this repo.
